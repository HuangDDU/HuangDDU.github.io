	abstract = {Trajectory inference algorithms based on single-cell omics data are powerful tools for predicting and dissecting cell differentiation. However, most existing tools are tailored to specific datasets and lack generalizability across diverse data types. To ad-dress this limitation, we developed CellFateExplorer, systematically evaluates the performance of x trajectory inference methods across y datasets. Through an interactive web interface, CellFateExplorer provides guidance on method selection and down-stream analysis for specific datasets. In summary, CellFateExplorer is an integrated platform for exploring cell fate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
