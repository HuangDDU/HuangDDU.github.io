abstract: Trajectory inference algorithms based on single-cell omics data are powerful
  tools for predicting and dissecting cell differentiation. However, most existing
  tools are tailored to specific datasets and lack generalizability across diverse
  data types. To ad-dress this limitation, we developed CellFateExplorer, systematically
  evaluates the performance of x trajectory inference methods across y datasets. Through
  an interactive web interface, CellFateExplorer provides guidance on method selection
  and down-stream analysis for specific datasets. In summary, CellFateExplorer is
  an integrated platform for exploring cell fate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
  have declared no competing interest.
